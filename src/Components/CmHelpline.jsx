        This project is an important and far-reaching initiative of the state
        government towards better governance, inaugurated on 23rd Febâ€™19. The
        aim of this project is to provide quick information and resolution to
        the grievances raised by the citizen. Also, we have designed our portal
        in such a flexible manner wherein we make sure that citizen shall
        provide their submission in the form of demand and suggestion. This is a
        category that remains separated from actual grievances.
