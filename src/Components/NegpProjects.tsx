        The National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), takes a holistic view of
        e-Governance initiatives across the country, integrating them into a
        collective vision, a shared cause. Around this idea, a massive
        countrywide infrastructure reaching down to the remotest of villages is
        evolving, and large-scale digitization of records is taking place to
        enable easy, reliable access to the internet.
        <br />
         Further, with a vision to
        transform e-Governance for transforming Governance and keeping in view
        the need to utilize emerging technologies such as Cloud and Mobile
        Platform and focus on the integration of services, the Government has
        proposed to implement “e-Kranti: National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) 2.0”
        under the Digital India programme
