        Government of Uttarakhand is committed to deploy IT as an effective tool
        for catalyzing accelerated economic growth, efficient governance and
        human resource development.
        <br />
        The Government of Uttarakhand recognized the potential of Information
        and Communication Technology (ICT) for rapid and all round development
        in general and transforming governance in particular. It was envisioned
        to make Government services accessible to the common man in his
        locality, through common service delivery outlets and ensure efficiency,
        transparency & reliability of such services at affordable costs to
        realize the basic needs of the common man.
        <br />
        To meet this objective, ITDA has set up a State Data Centre to provide
        efficient electronic service delivery of G2G, G2C and G2B services, to
        enable various State departments to host their services/applications on
        a common infrastructure leading to ease of integration and efficient
        management, ensuring that computing resources and the support
        connectivity infrastructure is adequately and optimally used.
        <br />
        The State Data Centre is a key-supporting element of e-Government
        Initiatives & businesses for delivering services to the citizens and
        Business with greater reliability, availability and serviceability with
        following Vision and Mission.
